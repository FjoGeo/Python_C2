# C2

## Architecture Overview

### C2 Server

    - Listens for connections from agents (via TCP or HTTP)
    - Receives agent info, sends commands
    - Stores logs (keystrokes, results, etc.)
    - Handles file transfers
    - Exposes a web dashboard (via Flask or FastAPI)

### Agent

    - Initiates connection (reverse shell model)
    - Listens for commands
    - Executes shell commands
    - Captures keystrokes (on host OS)
    - Handles file upload/download to/from server

## ðŸ§ª Development Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Agent â†” Server (Basic Command Shell)

    Build a TCP-based agent that:

        Connects to server

        Waits for shell commands

        Executes and sends back output

### âœ… Phase 2: File Upload/Download

    Implement file I/O:

        upload <filename> â†’ agent sends file

        download <filename> â†’ server sends file to agent

### âœ… Phase 3: Keystroke Logging

    Use platform-specific libraries:

        Windows/Linux: pynput or keyboard (requires admin/root access)

## âœ… Phase 4: Web Dashboard (Flask)

    Web interface to:

        View connected agents

        Send commands

        View logs

        Download files from agents
